Skytalks Demo Site
=================

Mostly stolen from [Bsidessf.org](https://bsidessf.org)

Running Locally
=================

To run the site locally, run ```bundle exec jekyll serve``` on the command line. The address will be listed as ```Server address``` in the output when this runs correctly.

If this isn't working, you may need to run ```bundle install``` to ensure you have the necessary gems.
